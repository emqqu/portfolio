    <h3>About Me (longer edition) ^_^</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>I'm Eemeli in internet known as Emppu. I'm 17 years old and I'm studying Software Development at Tampere Vocational College which is located in Hervanta, Finland.</li>
        <li>At the moment I'm learning these programming languages in school: PHP, JS, CSS and HTML, Laravel(framework).</li>
        <li>I'm much better at PHP than JS. We didn't really go much in detail with JS in the first year. Currently we're making a Reservation site. Me and my tyÃ¶pari are doing it with Laravel.</li>
        <li>My interests are: FOSS, Game Dev, Linux, Retro Stuff such as old PC's, video games, music etc.</li>
        <li>I'm also learning GDScript which is Godot Engine's own programming language. I'm also learning to draw as a hobby.</li>
        <li>My current dream is to make an Undertale Fan-Game and some other games. I got many ideas, but my procrastination never seems to end.</li>
        <li>I also love love love cats :D</li>
        <li>I guess that's pretty much it? I'll update this sometime later :'D</li>
