    <h3>About Me ^_^</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>I'm Eemeli and I'm 17 years old and I'm studying Software Development at Tampere Vocational College which is located in Hervanta, Finland.</li>
        <li>Currently we're studying web development with these programming languages: <ul class="listInlist">
            <li>PHP -- <strong>Pretty good at it</strong></li>
            <li>JS -- <strong>Still hard to understand most of the time.</strong></li>
            <li>HTML5 and CSS3 -- <strong>I'd say I'm very good at these.</strong></li>
            <li>Laravel(framework). -- <strong>Started learning it. Not bad I suppose.</strong></li>
            <li>GDScript -- <strong>I have a good understanding of it.</strong></li>
            <li>C# -- <strong>Been learning it in on-the-job training period. The language itself is not very hard. I still have lot to learn though :D</strong></li>
        </ul></li>
