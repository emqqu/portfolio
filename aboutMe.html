    <h3>About Me (longer edition) ^_^</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>I'm Eemeli in internet known as Emppu. I'm 16, turning 17 in August. I'm studying Software Development in Tredu Hepolamminkatu which locates in Hervanta, Finland.</li>
        <li>I'm studying at the moment these programming languages in school: PHP, JS, CSS and HTML.</li>
        <li>In knowledge sense, I'm much better at PHP than JS. We didn't really go much in detail with JS in the first year but when my second year starts we're going straight to React.</li>
        <li>My interests are: FOSS, Game Dev, Linux, Retro Stuff such as old PC's, video games, music etc.</li>
        <li>I'm also learning GDScript which is Godot Engine's own programming language. I'm also learning to draw human bodies, i'd say that im getting decent at it. Anatomy fucks up sometimes but I'm just gonna blame my left hand since I'm left-handed.</li>
        <li>My current dream is to make an Undertale Fan-Game and some other games. I got many ideas, but my procrastination phase never seems to leave :')</li>
        <li>I also love love love cats :D</li>
        <li>I guess that's pretty much it? I'll update this sometime later :'D</li>
    </ul>
